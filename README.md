Raspberry Pi and Arduino — Applications and Differences.

Defination :

Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit-card-sized single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation whereas, arduino is an open-source microcontroller platform designed for building digital devices and interactive objects.

What is the difference between Arduino and Raspberry Pi application?

Professional engineers may use both boards depending on the particular project. Arduino works well for home automation, robotics, and control systems. Raspberry Pi, on the other hand, is best for larger projects that need better processing capacity, like data analysis, AI, computer vision, etc.
